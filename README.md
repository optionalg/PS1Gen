# PS1Gen

PS1Gen is a small JavaScript tool that allows you to easily generate fancy PS1 command prompts for your favorite Unix Bash shell. A hosted version can be found over at [coding-journal.com](http://ps1gen.coding-journal.com), if you'd like to take it for a spin.

**Note that this is still a non-fully-functional WIP version, so don't expect to much from it yet.**


# Credits

This tool was inspired the original (?) [Bash $PS1 Generator](http://www.kirsle.net/wizards/ps1.html#help). The reason I rolled out my own one was that it does not allow re-ordering of the items and the colors are very limited.
